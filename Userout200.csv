Staff was always helpful and smiling, food was incredible, and rooms were exceptional. They also hosted a special barbecue lunch for us on the deck while cruising through sunset. We consider ourselves a bit lucky to take our tours in empty temples which allowed us to re live the history of our great ancestors and take great photos with happy memories, so we had to pay back to the locals specially during times like these when tourism is at it’s worst. You will find photos below from the highlights of the trip. This definitely won’t be the last time to team up with Sunrise and sail the south again!

Yet, portion of the food was a bit small. ( We went for Lunch) - Prices are very reasonable. The overall experience was awesome ❤️"

I have foreign residency until June, so plenty of time to see every nook and cranny. A month ago I posted looking for contacts in Port Said, and through this group, I connected with two beautiful ladies, Hanya Chahin and Shereen AboSamra, who… More showed me around Port Said and made my visit so special and memorable. During that exchange, I also spoke with a lot of Alexandrians who told me to let them know when I visited. Well, today I just took out a month lease in Bianchi, about half an hour west of Alexandria. I’m mega excited and pumped to see all of what Alexandria has to offer for the next month. And, I would love to share it with some locals or any Nomad members that may be visiting between now and the end of February. I’m sharing an apartment with my good friend, Abdelrahman Bannora, and we would both love to hear from you, hang out with you, sightsee, drink coffee, have dinner etc. So please drop us a DM, we’ll exchange whatapp details and arrange something. Yalla Beena! 🙌"

But, if anybody is from the area (or can recommend a friend in Port Said), who would like to hang out, exchange our… More cultures, have dinner, drink coffee, see the sights etc. I would love to meet you and arrange a time/date in Port Said suitable for us both.

I am not happy with that totally even the way customer services of EgyptAir handled the situation is very poor, there reply was "" it is allready discounted"" and actually they didn't take in consideration that this was the normal price they applied on all Cairo passengers.

Then I went and created another DS160… More application. When I entered this website https://www.ustraveldocs.com/eg/index.html. I edited the new DS 160 number and it appeared that the payment is processed. Is there any problem in that? Or should I go ahead and submit the documents to aramex? Thanks in advance.

,967,I would like to share a cost saving tip regarding airport transfers. You can book airport transfer through Expedia. The cheapest option is shared transportation and costs around 11-12 USD. The way it works is that they pick you up with a minivan and may have to pick up other people before/after you depending on your location relative to the… More airport. The thing is if your flight is at an ungodly hour you will probably be alone in the transportation and they will send you a private car. I tried it in Barcelona. They sent me a normal taxi at the specified time and the meter actually made 32 EUR but I only paid 10 through Expedia and gave the driver a small tip. I tried it again in Bucharest and the same thing happened. I was alone in a mercedes van for 10 EUR 🙂 It is more practical for single travelers because for two/three people the total would probably be like or close to a normal taxi. To book the service google expedia airport transfer and you will find the booking page.

I know that some hotels put cheap non egyptians rate and you cannot benefit from that rate if you don’t have a foreign nationality, any tips on what to avoid on booking ( p.s. i am booking from the UK, so might get the foreign rates ) should i just convert my currency to egy and that will do the trick ? Or is it just easier and safer to find a company to organize everything afte all ? Thanks"

,1333,"I want to share with you my experience at Nuweiba lodge. It was my first time to stay overnight at Nuweiba and alot of people have recommended it here at nomads. The room was more than amazing, it was very… More clean with an AC and toilet in the room. All the rooms are wood and two floors. We really enjoyed the food as well, it was really delicious and home-made. The owner (Misho) and the staff (Ali and the chef-I dont remember his name) are super friendly and very flexible. We asked them to make us a bonfire at dinner and they did, we also asked them to have our breakfast at the beach and they agreed as well. The owner went snorkling with us to show us the coral reefs area. They also have kayaks that is included in the package, no extra fees.😃 To sum up, We really enjoyed our stay at Nuweiba Lodge and we recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet, peaceful, clean place with super friendly staff 😃😃"

My questions are: 1) Serengeti National Park looks like the best option to see the big five but quite hard/expensive to reach. has anyone been there before? Is a typical one day game… More safari enough? How much is it? How did you reach it from Dar elsalam or Zanzibar? Fly to Arusha then start the safari from there? 2) another option is Mikumi National Park just due to its proximity to Dar elsalam. Is it good as well? How to reach it? Starting the safari from Dar elsalam? Please share your safari experience and feel free to recommend other national parks that have the big 5 or 4 as well 😊 Thanks!

I already reported this to EgyptAir and they don't seem to care. If they don't apply an exception to use the test result date instead of the sample collection they will have an empty airplane and many angry customers.

You should ask for it because if you didn't they won't… More give it back they will keep it and most likely give it back with the new one, but there is no evidence that they have it which i believe too risky since they own no responsibility if lost or anything happened to it..
